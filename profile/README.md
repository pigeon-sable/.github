## 🙋‍♀️ About pigeon-sable

It is a community for programming enthusiasts to get together, work on their own, and create products on their own.

## 🌈 Contribution guidelines

First, please Fork the repository.

Clone the program from the forked repository to your local environment.

After changing the program, push it to the Forked repository, and then throw a pull request to the Fork source (original repository).

Branch creation rules follow Git Flow. Thus, it consists of the following branches

- Main
- Develop
- Feature
- Release
- Hotfix

For more information, see Useful resource.

## 🧙 Remember

"Done is better than perfect. by Mark Elliot Zuckerberg"

No one can write a perfect program from the beginning.

Let's write more and more programs, learn many things, and grow.

Maybe there will be times when it is difficult to do it alone. That's what the community is for.

Let's work a little harder for our future selves!
